# FinTrack-Pro: Lab Financial Management System

A comprehensive financial management application designed to streamline financial administration within an academic or organizational lab setting.

This project was developed to provide a centralized platform for managing various financial transactions, including:
- **Lab Cash Funds**: Tracking and managing daily operational cash.
- **Imprest Funds**: Handling temporary cash advances for specific expenses.
- **Reimbursements**: Processing and approving expense claims.

By centralizing these functions, FinTrack-Pro enhances transparency and efficiency in financial management between labs, administrators, and external parties.
